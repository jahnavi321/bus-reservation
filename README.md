# bus-reservation

Simple bus ticket reservation system developed using mysql and php

setup: insall ticket db in mysql using ticketdb.sql
       copy bus reservation to /var/www/html folder.
       Access reservation application from browser, authenticate yourself to use the application for seat booking, view details and cancel tickets.
       
       As of now, admin functions to add/modify/delete routes, buses are manual operations. I plan to enhance this application to add required functionality in next version.
